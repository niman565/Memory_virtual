testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your three source files.
testhw places all of the results in results.txt in 
the directory with the source files in it.

I worked with a peer on this project. This is a simulation of a virtual memory, coded in C++. In order to run, simply run vm.out with
the desired input file. The input test files and testhw were made by an outside source. The results will be in a text file called 
"vm-out.txt".
